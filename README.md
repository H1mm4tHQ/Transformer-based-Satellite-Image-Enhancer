# üõ∞Ô∏è Transformer-Based Super-Resolution for Satellite Imagery

This project proposes a novel **Transformer-based Super-Resolution (SR)** model that enhances low-resolution satellite images using **geological context**. It integrates auxiliary modalities such as **QuickBird Panchromatic (QB)** and **Thermal Infrared (TIR)** images to improve spatial fidelity.

> ‚ú® Made by [Himmat](https://github.com/H1mm4tHQ) and [Anoop](https://github.com/anoopElGato) as part of a research-driven academic project.

## üöÄ Highlights

- üß† **Cross-Modality Attention**: RGB images query QB & TIR features to guide refinement.
- üåÄ **Hybrid Architecture**: Combines **transformers** for global context and **CNNs** for local texture enhancement.
- üéØ **Adversarial Training**: Employs a **Transformer-GAN**, with a transformer-based generator and CNN-based discriminator.
- üìä **Performance**:
  - PSNR: **33.87**
  - SSIM: **0.95**
