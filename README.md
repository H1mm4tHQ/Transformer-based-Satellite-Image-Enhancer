# üõ∞Ô∏è Transformer-Based Super-Resolution for Satellite Imagery

This project proposes a novel **Transformer-based Super-Resolution (SR)** model that enhances low-resolution satellite images using **geological context**. It integrates auxiliary modalities such as **QuickBird Panchromatic (QB)** and **Thermal Infrared (TIR)** images to improve spatial fidelity.

## üöÄ Highlights

- üß† **Cross-Modality Attention**: RGB images query QB & TIR features to guide refinement.
- üåÄ **Hybrid Architecture**: Combines **transformers** for global context and **CNNs** for local texture enhancement.
- üéØ **Adversarial Training**: Employs a **Transformer-GAN**, with a transformer-based generator and CNN-based discriminator.
- üìä **Performance**:
  - PSNR: **33.87**
  - SSIM: **0.95**

## üìÇ Dataset

- Sourced from [USGS Earth Explorer](https://earthexplorer.usgs.gov)
- Selected regions from **Northern India**
- Includes RGB, Panchromatic, and TIR imagery

---

## üß† Model Architecture

The model consists of:

- **Transformer Blocks** for capturing long-range spatial dependencies across modalities
- **Residual CNN Blocks** for texture recovery
- **Attention Fusion** to integrate RGB, QB, and TIR
- **Discriminator** for GAN training using a CNN classifier

Training involves:

- **Content Loss (L1)** + **Adversarial Loss**
- **PSNR/SSIM** used for evaluation
- **Mixed Precision Training** via PyTorch AMP
